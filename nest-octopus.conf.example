# Temperature tiers: <temp>@<price> format
# Set different temperatures based on electricity price thresholds.
# Price can be a percentage of average (e.g., 50%, 75%) or absolute pence (e.g., 15p).
# Multiple tiers can be specified, space-separated.
# Example: 22@50% 20@75% means 22°C when price < 50% avg, 20°C when < 75%
price_threshold = 20@75%

# Default temperature when no tier threshold is met (°C)

# ECO mode threshold (optional)
# ECO mode is enabled when price exceeds this threshold.
# Can be percentage (e.g., 133%) or absolute pence (e.g., 25p).
# eco_threshold = 133%
